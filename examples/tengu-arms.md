## Tie-along narration 

1) Right wrist single-column; route to back, then to the left forearm (ventral)

Take the right wrist (WR.R). Using Rope A’s ~4″ bight, tie a single-column (SC) around the wrist. 
Bring/hold the right forearm with the right upper arm (+FA.R/UA.R)—i.e., gently encourage a natural bend so the cuff won’t migrate.
Travel with the working end to the upper backupper chest, dorsal (CHU.D), landing below the shoulder blades. Lay the rope flat; this spot will become a routing hub.
Continue travel to the left forearm, ventral (FA.L.V)—i.e., around to the front/inside of the left forearm readying for the left side work.

2) Left wrist hojo cuff; chest reverse friction; anchor via half-hitch

First, bring/hold the left forearm with the left upper arm (+FA.L/UA.L) to mirror the gentle bend you made on the right.
Tie a Hojo cuff (HC) on the left wrist (WR.L). Keep it neat; confirm you can still rotate a finger under the bands.
Travel back to the upper chest, dorsal (CHU.D) and form a reverse friction (RF) there—this locks routing without a bulky knot.
Travel to the right forearm (FA.R) to pick up that side’s line path, then return to upper chest, dorsal, medial (CHU.D.M)—the center-back spine line between shoulder blades.
At CHU.D.M, secure a half-hitch (HH) to hold position before building chest bands.

3) First chest rope band with firm tension; route L-arm → sternum → R-arm → back; lock with RF

At CHU.D.M, build a rope band (RB) across the chest with tension: firm (t:firm). Keep it parallel and smooth.
Travel to the left upper arm (UA.L), laying the band cleanly where it will sit comfortably above the deltoid contour (avoid pinching).
Travel across to the upper chest, ventral (CHU.V)—aim specifically for the sternal gap. Keep bands neatly stacked without crossing unless intended.
Travel onward to the right upper arm (UA.R), mirroring position and spacing to the left.
Return to CHU.D.M and fix with a reverse friction (RF) to lock that first chest circuit.

4) Second chest rope band (caudal bias); route R-arm → sternum → L-arm → back; finish HH @ 7:30

Still at CHU.D.M, lay a second rope band (RB) with directional bias caudal (RB.CD)—i.e., this pass sits slightly lower than the first band, maintaining firm tension (t:firm) and parallel aesthetics.
Travel to the right upper arm (UA.R), laying the caudal (lower) pass in a comfortable lane under the first band (avoid stacking on nerves).
Travel to CHU.V (front chest) again, keeping spacing even across the sternum.
Travel to the left upper arm (UA.L) to mirror the right side path.
Return to CHU.D.M and finish with a half-hitch (HH) set with an exit angle @ 7:30 (down-left from your perspective), so your tail exits cleanly and won’t dig.

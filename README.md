# shibari-shorthand 

Experiments in Shorthand for Shibari Ties by @XTCatalyst on FetLife.

This repo is an exploration in using shorthand notation for Shibari.  Here is the evolving [Definition](./definition.md) and here are some [Examples](./examples).  Most of us have watched a video, or been at a class, and the presenter goes to fast as we madly write things down.  WOuldn't it 

The shorthand was inspired by knitting/crochet shorthand.  It was kickstarted with chatgpt.

## Rope can be dangerous

Rope can damage your body, do classes, get training, practice safely.  Don't tie outside your skill level unless with a teacher.

## Why don't you have descriptions of what the knots or ties are?  

This is first and foremost an expirment in capturing ties.   It's optimized for my note taking.  You can tweak it yourself.

## What does it look like?

### Upper chest band (front, high on the chest)

```
A CHU.V: RB x2 cw ; CP (sternal gap) ; XF @3 t:firm !nerve
```

## Converting to tie along

We live in the time of emrging LLMs.  Try this prompt

```
I am using a Shibari Shorthand Notation here is it's defintion

<paste defintion.md>

I'd like you to convert the following ties into a tie-along narrated form. 

<paste tie>
```

See [examples](./examples) for the output of this prompt.
